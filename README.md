This repository contains the code for the post `AutoML Framework Comparison Part 2: AutoML With Genetic Programming In TPOT` ([link](https://kedion.medium.com/automl-framework-comparison-9924cf238691)) on the Kedion blog on Medium. 

The code covers the basics of automated machine learning with the [TPOT framework] (http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/). Additionally, the notebooks contain tests between H2O and TPOT.
